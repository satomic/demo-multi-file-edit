# My Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the direction of the snake.
3. The objective is to eat the food that appears on the screen. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer.
4. Avoid running into the walls or into yourself.

## Additional Notes

- The game is responsive and should work on most modern browsers.
- You can modify the styles in `style.css` to change the appearance of the game.
- The game logic can be found in `app.js`, where you can also add new features or improve the gameplay.
